openbibl
========

The Open <bibl> Project is a collection of stylesheets and standards for publishing scholarly bibliographies to the web using XML, RDF, and web standards.

A detailed README is coming soon. We will soon have open <bibl> project stylesheets available, including:
1) custom TEI schema
2) XSLT, CSS stylesheets
3) ontology file
4) schema.org extensions

In the meantime, if you have questions about the project or would like to be involved, please contact Dawn Childress (dawn@psu.edu) or Kevin Clair (kevin.clair@du.edu).
