openbibl
========

The Open <bibl> Project is a collection of stylesheets and standards for publishing scholarly and descriptive bibliographies to the web using XML, RDF, and web standards.

Open <bibl> is a collaboration between Dawn Childress, Kevin Clair, and Nathan Day.

A detailed README is coming soon. We will soon have open <bibl> project stylesheets available, including:
1) custom TEI templates
2) XSLT, CSS, javascript
4) schema.org extensions

In the meantime, if you have questions about the project or would like to be involved, please contact us at dawn@psu.edu.
