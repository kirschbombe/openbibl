           <note>
              <p>Writings on the Eucharist by the Dominican friar and German philosopher Albertus Magnus (1206-1280), also known as Saint Albert the Great. Albertus was one of the first medieval scholars to apply Aristotle’s philosophy to Christian thought. and was an advocate for the coexistence of science and religion. Albertus’ Summa was a standard orthodox treatise on Holy Communion, and was likely important to the Czech Romanists in their conflict with the Utraquists. The Utraquists, a moderate faction of the Hussites, maintained the Eucharist should be administered to the people in both bread and wine, but wine was then reserved only for the priests.</p>
              <p>Winterberg (Vimperk), a small town in the southwest near the Bavarian border, was the second Czech town with a printing press. The printer Johannes Alakraw produced only two books in Winterberg in 1484, one of which was the Summa. Alakraw worked previously in Passau with the printer Conrad Stahel and with Benedictus Mayr, from whom he borrowed the unusual practice of signing his books by the sheet, with consecutive letters of the alphabet, rather than by the quire. In 1485 he returned to Passau where he printed until 1492.</p>

           <note>
              <p>Printed in Prague by the partners Jan Severin and Jan Kamp, this is the first printing of the complete Bible in the Czech language. The text is a translation from early texts into the Bohemian vernacular by unknown Czech scholars associated with the Hussite movement, and revised by Jan Hus, Martin Lupác, and others. The Prague Bible has often been called the first Protestant Bible because of the connection with the Hussites, although there was an earlier printing in 1475 of the New Testament in Czech.</p>

              <p>The first detailed lunar atlas, depicting more than 200 lunar formations. With the invention of the telescope in the early 17th century, astronomers could map the planets and constellations just as cartographers were mapping the geography of the earth. As the closest object to the earth, the moon quickly became a favorite object of study for many astronomers. One of the greatest of these astronomers was Jan Hevelius (1611-1687), born in Gdansk. In Selenographia, Hevelius created an authoritative atlas and study of the moon derived from his own observations. Hevelius had one of the most well-equipped observatories in Europe, covering the rooftops of several buildings, complete with a revolving observation hut, telescopes and astronomical instruments which he made himself, and even a printing press to produce his copperplate engravings. The majority of plates were engraved by Hevelius in his observatory where he could produce the most detailed and accurate illustrations. The volume contains 133 engraved plates depicting the moon and its phases, as well as illustrations of the instruments he created. This is perhaps Hevelius’ greatest work.</p>

            <note>
               <p>The text of the 1489 Biblia Bohemica follows that of the 1488 Prague Bible translated and revised by Jan Hus and his followers, with corrections and amended orthography, and the addition of the Epistle to the Laodiceans. The additional woodcut illustrations are hand-colored and were strongly influenced by the illustrations of the Cologne Bible of 1478, or possibly they were taken from bibles produced in Cologne during the late 1470's. This is the first Czech illustrated bible.</p>
               <p>This work represents one of only two works printed in Kuttenberg in the 15th century and the only printer known to have worked there, Martin of Tischniova. The book concludes with a large printer's device of a crowned W, for King Wladislaw of Bohemia, above the arms of Kuttenberg supported by two miners. The device was possibly a token of debt to the Town Council, from whom the printer borrowed a large sum in order to complete the work.</p>

               <p>First edition of a rare book on health and nutrition by the Polish Renaissance scholar Maciej z Miechowa (1457-1523) in which he discusses food and wine and their effects on health. Maciej also addresses medicinal uses for food and wine, in particular the benefits of a wine derived from absinthe that miraculously relieves pain, restores appetite, and works as a cure for epilepsy. Maciej was the physician to the kings of Poland and Hungary, as well as the founder of several colleges and libraries, and is most known for his Chronica Polonorum, a valuable history of Poland, and his Tractatus de duabus Sarmatiis, considered the first accurate geographical and ethnographical description of Eastern Europe.</p>

               <p>A reprint of the Biblia Leopolity originally printed in 1561 by Marek Szarffenberg and son Stanisława, sometimes called the Biblia Szarffenbergowska. Although its origins are obscure, this version of the Bible is thought to have been translated from the Vulgate by an unknown translator, but speculation has focused on the Dominican friar Leonard. Leonard was the confessor of Zygmunt II August I (1520-1572), King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, to whom the translation is dedicated. Prepared and corrected by Jan Nicz of Lwow (or Leopolita), this was the first Catholic version as well as the first complete printing of a Polish language Bible.</p>

               <p>The first edition of the Unitas Fratrum (later, the Moravian Church) version of the Bible, known as the Kralitz Bible. Translated into Czech from the original languages, the translators worked from the Antwerp Polyglot bible, as well as existing Latin commentaries. The Bible was printed at the castle Kralice by the printeer Zacharius Solin, and funded by John von Zerotin, an influential baron and owner of the castle. This version marks the first time the apocrypha and canonical books are separated in a Bohemian bible. With prefaces, summaries, marginal annotations, references, tables, and commentaries. This celebrated translation became the model for classical Czech and at the same time a highlight of Czech typography.</p>

               <p>Margaritare, or Pearls, is an anthology of the religious homilies of St. John Chrysostom, the 4th century Archbishop of Constantinople, compiled by, and possibly printed under the direction of the Romanian Anthimus of Iberia. Antimus, a linguist, typographer, and writer, compiled the Margaritare as a guide to living a Christian life. This version of the anthology was translated into Romanian by the brothers Serban and Radul Grecénu, publishers of first Romanian edition of the complete Bible (1688), which is considered a monument of 17th century Romanian literature for its elegant style and diction.
