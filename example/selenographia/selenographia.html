                    <div>The first detailed lunar atlas, depicting more than 200 lunar formations. With
                        the invention of the telescope in the early 17th century, astronomers could map
                        the planets and constellations just as cartographers were mapping the geography
                        of the earth. As the closest object to the earth, the moon quickly became a
                        favorite object of study for many astronomers. One of the greatest of these
                        astronomers was Jan Hevelius (1611&#x2013;1687), born in Gdansk. In
                        Selenographia, Hevelius created an authoritative atlas and study of the moon
                        derived from his own observations. Hevelius had one of the most well-equiped
                        observatories in Europe, covering the rooftops of several buildings, complete
                        with a revolving observation hut, telescopes and astronomical intruments which
                        he made himself, and even a printing press to produce his copperplate
                        engravings. The majority of plates were engraved by Hevelius in his observatory
                        where he could produce the most detailed and accurate illustrations. The volume
                        contains 133 engraved plates depicting the moon and its phases, as well as
                        illustrations of the instruments he created. This is perhaps Hevelius’ greatest
                        work.</div>
