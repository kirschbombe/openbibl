title: 'TEI snippet: Selenographia'

Here is a snippet with an entry from a descriptive bibliography, using `<div type="entry">` as the entry level element. Within the div, this example uses `<biblStruct>` for the bibliographic info and `<msDesc>` for collation, physical description, and provenance. The annotation in this case is using the `<summary>` element within `<msDesc>`, but I am leaning toward a third element after `<msDesc>` for annotations. The published entry should look something like this:
